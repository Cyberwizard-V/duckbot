## Current Focus

Currently, our primary focus is on developing the backend and setting up an API using C#. üòä

### Objectives:

- **Getting the API Running**: Our immediate goal is to establish the API's functionality.

---

## Additional Objectives

In addition to the primary objective, here are some other tasks we're working on:

- **Database Update**: Transitioning our data, such as quotes, from static lists to a dynamic database. This will enable administrators to manage content through a dashboard, enhancing flexibility and scalability.

- **Initializing Vue Frontend**: We're preparing to kickstart the Vue.js frontend project to complement our backend efforts, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Implementing User Authentication**: Creating a login system to enhance security and personalize user experiences.

- **Building an Admin Dashboard**: Developing a dedicated dashboard for administrators to manage application settings, content, and user permissions efficiently.
